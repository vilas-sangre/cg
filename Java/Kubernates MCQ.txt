A service in Kubernetes is an abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy to access them. It acts as a stable endpoint to connect to a group of pods, providing load balancing and service discovery functionality. By defining a service, applications can easily communicate with each other without needing to know the specific IP addresses or ports of individual pods.

 10. 
To create a new deployment in kubernetes, use the command

A.
Kubernetes set deployment


B.
Kubernetes get deployment


C.
Kubectl run


D.
Kubectl deploy

Correct Answer
C. Kubectl run
Explanation
The correct answer is "kubectl run" because this command is used to create a new deployment in Kubernetes. It allows users to run a particular image on the cluster and manage it as a deployment. The "kubectl run" command is commonly used to quickly create and deploy containers in Kubernetes.

 11. 
The command to create Kubernetes service is

A.
Kubectl expose


B.
Kubectl set service


C.
Kubectl run


D.
Kubectl deploy

Correct Answer
A. Kubectl expose
Explanation
The correct answer is "kubectl expose" because this command is used to create a Kubernetes service. It allows the user to expose a deployment, replication controller, or pod as a new service. This command is essential for setting up networking within a Kubernetes cluster and making the service accessible to other pods or external clients.

 12. 
Kube-apiserver on kubernetes master is designed to scale. 

A.
Vertically


B.
Horizontally

Correct Answer
B. Horizontally
Explanation
The correct answer is horizontally. This means that the kube-apiserver on the Kubernetes master is designed to scale by adding more instances of the kube-apiserver horizontally. Horizontal scaling involves adding more machines or instances to distribute the workload and increase capacity. This allows for better performance and handling of increased traffic or demand in a Kubernetes cluster.

 13. 
Following k8s resources do not associate with any namespace.

A.
DaemonSets


B.
PersistentVolumes


C.
ReplicaSets


D.
Nodes


E.
Services

Correct Answer(s)
B. PersistentVolumes
D. Nodes
Explanation
PersistentVolumes and Nodes do not associate with any namespace in Kubernetes.

PersistentVolumes are storage resources that exist independently of any namespace and can be accessed by any pod in the cluster. They provide a way to store data that needs to persist beyond the lifetime of a pod.

Nodes, on the other hand, represent the worker machines in the cluster and are responsible for running pods. They are not associated with any specific namespace as they are part of the cluster infrastructure rather than an application or service running within a namespace.

 14. 
The Service Type _____________ works only if your cluster is setup to work with a cloud provider.

A.
ClusterIP


B.
NodePort


C.
LoadBalancer


D.
ExternalName

Correct Answer
C. LoadBalancer
Explanation
The LoadBalancer service type works only if your cluster is set up to work with a cloud provider. This is because a LoadBalancer service type requires the cloud provider's load balancer to distribute traffic to the service. If the cluster is not set up with a cloud provider, the load balancer functionality will not be available, and therefore the LoadBalancer service type cannot be used.

 15. 
This volume type can be used to share contents within containers in a pod, but will not persist beyond the life of a pod.

A.
EmptyDir


B.
FlexVolume


C.
ConfigMap


D.
Local

Correct Answer
A. EmptyDir
Explanation
The emptyDir volume type can be used to share contents within containers in a pod. It creates an empty directory on the host machine and mounts it into the pod. However, the contents of this volume will not persist beyond the life of the pod. Once the pod is terminated or restarted, the contents of the emptyDir volume will be lost.

 16. 
__________________ is responsible for health check of the pods running on individual nodes

A.
Kubectl


B.
Kube controller manager


C.
Kube scheduler


D.
Kubelet

Correct Answer
D. Kubelet
Explanation
The kubelet is responsible for the health check of the pods running on individual nodes. It is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster and ensures that the containers in the pods are running and healthy. The kubelet communicates with the Kubernetes API server to receive instructions about which pods to run and monitor. It also reports the status of the pods back to the API server.

 17.

 18. 
_________ service is automatically created for you k8s cluster creation and takes care of the internal routing of the cluster.

A.
NodePort


B.
ClusterIP


C.
Headless


D.
Load Balancer

Correct Answer
B. ClusterIP
Explanation
A ClusterIP service is automatically created for you during k8s cluster creation and it takes care of the internal routing of the cluster. ClusterIP is a type of service in Kubernetes that assigns a virtual IP address to a set of pods. This IP address allows communication between the pods within the cluster, but it is not accessible from outside the cluster. ClusterIP services are used for internal communication and are not exposed to the external network.
